# SMS Delivery Issue: Sandbox vs Production Environment

## Current Issue

Your SMS messages are showing as "SUCCESS" in the database but users aren't receiving them. This is because you're currently using Africa's Talking **SANDBOX environment**.

## Sandbox vs Production

### Sandbox Environment (Current Setup)
- **Username**: `sandbox`
- **Purpose**: Testing and development only
- **Behavior**: 
  - API accepts messages and returns "Success" status
  - **NO ACTUAL SMS MESSAGES ARE DELIVERED**
  - Messages are only simulated for testing purposes
  - Free to use for development

### Production Environment (Required for Real SMS)
- **Username**: Your actual Africa's Talking username (not "sandbox")
- **Purpose**: Real SMS delivery to actual phone numbers
- **Behavior**:
  - API sends real SMS messages to recipients
  - Messages are actually delivered to users' phones
  - Costs real money per SMS sent

## How to Fix This

To send real SMS messages that users will receive, you need to:

1. **Get Production Credentials**:
   - Sign up for a production account at https://account.africastalking.com
   - Get your actual username (not "sandbox")
   - Get your production API key
   - Add credit to your account for sending SMS

2. **Update Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   export AFRICAS_TALKING_USERNAME="your-actual-username"
   export AFRICAS_TALKING_API_KEY="your-production-api-key"
   ```

3. **Restart the Application**:
   The app will automatically use the new credentials

## Current Status

- ‚úÖ Application is working correctly
- ‚úÖ Database is tracking all campaigns and costs
- ‚úÖ SMS API integration is functional
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Currently in SANDBOX mode (no real delivery)
- üì± Need production credentials for real SMS delivery

## Testing in Sandbox

In sandbox mode, you can verify:
- Message formatting
- Phone number validation
- Database tracking
- Cost calculation
- All application features

The only difference in production will be that users actually receive the SMS messages.
